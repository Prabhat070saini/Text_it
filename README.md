Web Chat Application Using Image Steganography

This is a web chat application that uses image steganography to encrypt messages and ensure secure communication between users. The application allows users to exchange messages and images in a secure and private environment.

Demo of Web Chat Application
How it works

The application uses an algorithm to hide messages within the pixels of an image. When a user sends a message, the application encrypts the message using the steganography algorithm and embeds it within the pixels of an image. The image is then sent to the recipient, who can use the same algorithm to extract the hidden message from the pixels of the image.
